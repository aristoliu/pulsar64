# Pulsar64 Chess Bot

This is a chess bot written in node.js that plays at the club level. It can be found on Lichess here: https://lichess.org/@/Pulsar64.

This project was created between 10/20 - 03/21 and has been uploaded to github in 01/22 with no changes to the old code. 

Two files comprise the project:
* ``index.js`` handles communication with the Lichess servers
* ``evaluation.js`` provides functionality for the bot to play good moves
